The demand for minimally invasive solutions for weight management and the growing prevalence of lifestyle-related disorders, such as diabetes and hypertension, are further driving market expansion. According to recent analyses, the market was valued at approximately <strong>$800 million</strong> in 2024.

This growth projection indicates a market size of approximately <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> by 2032. The increasing number of obesity cases, combined with rising healthcare costs associated with surgical procedures, is leading to a trend where patients and healthcare providers are opting for less invasive techniques. Moreover, the introduction of innovative products with enhanced safety profiles and patient-friendly designs is also fueling market growth.</p>  <p>As the awareness of obesity-related health risks spreads and more people seek effective weight loss options, the intragastric balloon is expected to gain traction.
